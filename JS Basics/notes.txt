Javascript is a dynamically typed language.

Rules for variables:
1. Variable names are case sensitive; "a" and "A" is different.
2. Only letters, digits, underscore(_) and $ is allowed.(not even space)
3. Only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character.
4. Reserved words cannot be variable names.

Let, const and var:
var -> Variable can be re-declared updated. A global scope variable.
let -> Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.
const -> Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.

We can update let, but cannot const. But, we can update the key of a const object.

If we add a number to a string, it will concatenate. "123" + 1 = "1231".

Strings in JS are immutable but arrays in JS are mutable.

Array methods -> pop()- deletes the last element & shift() - deletes the first element.

functions prevent redundancy(repetition).
function invoke - function ko bulana.

func params -> like local variables of function -> block scope 

arrow func format:
function functionName = (params) => {
    write the task;
}

In JS, functions can be used as parameters.

Higher order function/method -> Which uses other function as a parameter or returns other function.

Filter method of array -> It filters the elements of the array acc to the given condition.
