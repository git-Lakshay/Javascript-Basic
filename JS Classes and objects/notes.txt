JS objects have a special property called prototype.

If object and prototype have same method, object's method will be used.

When we made same function in prototype and object, the function of the object is executed.

In this.brand = brand, first brand is the property of object as it is written with this keyword and the second brand is the parameter used in the function.

The new keyword used in making an object finds the constructor in the main class and if there is no constructor, it automatically makes a default constructor.

if child and parent have same method, child's method will be used.[Method Overriding]

We have to give name parameter in super keyword to invoke the parent class constructor.

We can access parent class properties and method with the help of super keyword.
